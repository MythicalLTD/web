# Installing FeatherWings

## Supported Systems

The following is a list of supported operating systems. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list—there is a high probability that you can run FeatherWings on other Linux distributions with minimal adjustments. You are responsible for determining which packages may be necessary on those systems. Newer releases of the supported OSes below are also likely to work, even if not explicitly listed.

| Operating System                | Version  | Supported | Notes                                                         |
|---------------------------------|----------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ubuntu**                      | 20.04    | ✅        | Documentation assumes Ubuntu 20.04 as the base OS.            |
|                                 | 22.04    | ✅        |                                                               |

If your system is not listed above, you may still be able to install and run FeatherWings by installing the required dependencies for your distribution.


# System Requirements

To run FeatherWings, you will need a Linux system capable of running Docker containers. Most VPS and almost all dedicated servers should be capable of running Docker, but there are edge cases.

When your provider uses Virtuozzo, OpenVZ (or OVZ), or LXC virtualization, you will most likely be unable to run FeatherWings. Some providers have made the necessary changes for nested virtualization to support Docker. Ask your provider's support team to make sure. KVM is guaranteed to work.

The easiest way to check is to type `systemd-detect-virt`. If the result doesn't contain OpenVZ or LXC, it should be fine. The result of `none` will appear when running dedicated hardware without any virtualization.

Should that not work for some reason, or you're still unsure, you can also run the command below.

```bash
sudo dmidecode -s system-manufacturer
```

Example output:
```
VMware, Inc.
```

## Dependencies

- curl
- Docker

## Installing Docker

For a quick install of Docker CE, you can execute the command below:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable bash
```

If you would rather do a manual installation, please reference the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for how to install Docker CE on your server.

## Check your Kernel

Please be aware that some hosts install a modified kernel that does not support important docker features. Please check your kernel by running `uname -r`. If your kernel ends in `-xxxx-grs-ipv6-64` or `-xxxx-mod-std-ipv6-64` you're probably using a non-supported kernel.

## Start Docker on Boot

If you are on an operating system with systemd (Ubuntu 16+, Debian 8+, CentOS 7+) run the command below to have Docker start when you boot your machine.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

## Enabling Swap

### Recent Linux kernel

Since the version 6.1 of the Linux kernel, swap is enabled by default. If you are running a kernel version 6.1 or newer, you can skip this step. To check your kernel version, run `uname -r`.

On most systems, Docker will be unable to setup swap space by default. You can confirm this by running `docker info` and looking for the output of `WARNING: No swap limit support` near the bottom.

Enabling swap is entirely optional, but we recommended doing it if you will be hosting for others and to prevent OOM errors.

To enable swap, open `/etc/default/grub` as a root user and find the line starting with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`. Make sure the line includes `swapaccount=1` somewhere inside the double-quotes.

After that, run `sudo update-grub` followed by `sudo reboot` to restart the server and have swap enabled. Below is an example of what the line should look like, do not copy this line verbatim. It often has additional OS-specific parameters.

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="swapaccount=1"
```

### GRUB Configuration

Some Linux distros may ignore `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`. Therefore you might have to use `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` instead should the default one not work for you.


## Installing FeatherWings (Canary)

:::warning Canary Release
This is a **canary release** of FeatherWings - it is even before alpha and is intended for early adopters and developers who want to start experimenting with FeatherWings. **Do not use this in production environments** as it may contain bugs, incomplete features, or breaking changes.
:::

### Installing Wings

The first step for installing Wings is to ensure we have the required directory structure setup. To do so, run the commands below, which will create the base directory and download the wings executable.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/pelican /var/run/wings
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/wings "https://github.com/pelican-dev/wings/releases/latest/download/wings_linux_$([[ "$(uname -m)" == "x86_64" ]] && echo "amd64" || echo "arm64")"
sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/wings
```

### Configure

Once you have installed Wings and the required components, the next step is to create a node on your installed Panel. Go to your Panel administrative view, select Nodes from the sidebar, and on the right side click Create New button.

After you have created a node, click on it and there will be a tab called Configuration. Copy the code block content, create a new file at `/etc/pelican/config.yml`, paste the content into it and save.

Alternatively, you can click on the Auto Deploy Command button, copy the sh command and paste it into your terminal.

### Using SSL?

If your Panel is using SSL, then Wings must also use SSL.

See Creating SSL Certificates documentation page for how to create these certificates before continuing.

### Starting Wings

To start Wings, simply run the command below, which will start it in a debug mode. Once you confirmed that it is running without errors, use CTRL+C to terminate the process and daemonize it by following the instructions below. Depending on your server's internet connection pulling and starting Wings for the first time may take a few minutes.

```bash
sudo wings --debug
```

You may optionally add the `--debug` flag to run Wings in debug mode.

### Daemonizing (using systemd)

Running Wings in the background is a simple task, just make sure that it runs without errors before doing this. Place the contents below in a file called `wings.service` in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Wings Daemon
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service
PartOf=docker.service

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/etc/pelican
LimitNOFILE=4096
PIDFile=/var/run/wings/daemon.pid
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/wings
Restart=on-failure
StartLimitInterval=180
StartLimitBurst=30
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then, run the commands below to reload systemd and start Wings.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now wings
```
