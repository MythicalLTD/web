# FeatherPanel Plugin System

FeatherPanel features a comprehensive plugin system that allows developers to extend functionality through modular addons. This guide covers everything you need to know about creating, developing, and managing plugins.

## Quick Start

1. **Enable Developer Mode** in FeatherPanel settings
2. **Use the Plugin Manager** to create new plugins (recommended)
3. **Follow the file structure** and implement required interfaces
4. **Test your plugin** using the built-in validation tools

## Documentation Structure

- **[Plugin Architecture](./architecture)** - How plugins work and are loaded
- **[Plugin Configuration](./configuration)** - conf.yml and settings management
- **[Plugin Events & Hooks](./events)** - Event system and hooking into FeatherPanel
- **[Plugin Development](./development)** - Creating plugins and file structure
- **[Plugin Dependencies](./dependencies)** - Managing dependencies and requirements
- **[Plugin Examples](./examples)** - Complete plugin examples and templates

## What Plugins Can Do

FeatherPanel plugins can:

- **Hook into system events** (user login, server creation, etc.)
- **Add database tables** with automatic migrations
- **Create scheduled tasks** (cron jobs)
- **Add CLI commands** for server management
- **Integrate with the frontend** (dashboard, admin panel)
- **Create API endpoints** for external integrations
- **Manage settings** with persistent storage
- **Handle file uploads** and public assets

## Plugin Types

## Getting Started

The easiest way to create a plugin is using the **Plugin Manager** in the FeatherPanel admin interface:

1. Navigate to **Admin â†’ Plugin Manager**
2. Click **"Create New Plugin"**
3. Fill in your plugin details
4. The system generates a complete plugin structure
5. Customize the generated code for your needs

For manual creation, see the [Plugin Development](./development) guide.
