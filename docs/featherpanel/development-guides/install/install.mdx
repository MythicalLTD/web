# Developer Installation

FeatherPanel can be installed manually for development purposes, allowing live development and testing of the panel.

:::warning Developer Only
This installation method is **intended for developers only**. It is **not recommended for production use** or normal users, as running the panel in this way can be risky and is difficult to maintain. Proceed only if you understand the risks and are comfortable with development environments.
:::

## Prerequisites

### Supported Operating Systems

The following operating systems are officially supported for development:

| Operating System                | Version  | Supported | Notes                                                         |

If your system is not listed above, you may still be able to install and run FeatherPanel by installing the required dependencies for your distribution.

### System Requirements

To run FeatherPanel in development mode, you will need:

- A Linux system capable of running Docker containers
- Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
- At least 10GB of free disk space
- Root or sudo access

:::info Virtualization Check
When your provider uses Virtuozzo, OpenVZ (or OVZ), or LXC virtualization, you will most likely be unable to run FeatherPanel. Some providers have made the necessary changes for nested virtualization to support Docker. Ask your provider's support team to make sure. KVM is guaranteed to work.

Check your virtualization type:
```bash
systemd-detect-virt
```

If the result doesn't contain OpenVZ or LXC, it should be fine. The result of `none` will appear when running dedicated hardware without any virtualization.
:::

### Dependencies

- `curl` - for downloading files
- `git` - for cloning the repository
- `Docker` - for containerization
- `Docker Compose` - for multi-container orchestration

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Docker

For a quick installation of Docker CE, execute the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable bash
```

:::tip Manual Installation
If you prefer a manual installation, please reference the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your specific distribution.
:::

### 2. Verify Docker Installation

Check that Docker is properly installed:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

### 3. Start Docker Service

Enable and start Docker on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

### 4. Check Kernel Compatibility

Some hosts install modified kernels that don't support important Docker features. Check your kernel:

```bash
uname -r
```

If your kernel ends in `-xxxx-grs-ipv6-64` or `-xxxx-mod-std-ipv6-64`, you're probably using an unsupported kernel.

### 5. Enable Swap (Optional but Recommended)

Since Linux kernel version 6.1, swap is enabled by default. Check your kernel version:

```bash
uname -r
```

If you're running kernel 6.1 or newer, you can skip this step.

To enable swap support for Docker:

1. Open `/etc/default/grub` as root
2. Find the line starting with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`
3. Add `swapaccount=1` inside the double-quotes
4. Update GRUB and reboot:

```bash
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```

Example configuration:
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash swapaccount=1"
```

:::note GRUB Configuration
Some Linux distributions may ignore `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`. If the default doesn't work, try using `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` instead.
:::

## Development Setup

### 1. Create Development Directory

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www
cd /var/www
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mythicalltd/featherpanel.git featherpanel
cd featherpanel
```

### 3. Start Development Environment

```bash
docker compose up -d -f docker-compose-dev.yml
```

### 4. Verify Installation

Check that the containers are running:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

The panel should now be accessible at `http://localhost:4830`.

## Reverse Proxy Configuration

To access your development panel from external networks, you'll need to set up a reverse proxy. Here are configurations for popular web servers:

### Nginx Configuration

#### HTTP Only (Development)

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4830;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_buffering off;
    }
}
```

#### HTTPS (Production)

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_session_cache shared:le_nginx_SSL:10m;
    ssl_session_timeout 1440m;
    ssl_session_tickets off;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4830;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_buffering off;

        # WebSocket support
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}
```

### Apache Configuration

#### HTTP Only (No SSL)

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName your-domain.com

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:4830/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:4830/
</VirtualHost>
```

#### HTTPS (SSL)

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName your-domain.com
    Redirect permanent / https://your-domain.com/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName your-domain.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:4830/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:4830/

    # WebSocket support
    ProxyPass /ws/ ws://localhost:4830/ws/
    ProxyPassReverse /ws/ ws://localhost:4830/ws/
</VirtualHost>
```

#### Enable Required Apache Modules

```bash
sudo a2enmod ssl proxy proxy_http proxy_wstunnel
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

## Development Workflow

### Accessing the Panel

Once everything is set up, you can access your development panel at:

- **Local access**: `http://localhost:4830`
- **External access**: `http://your-domain.com` (if reverse proxy is configured)

### Stopping the Development Environment

To stop the development environment:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Restarting the Development Environment

To restart the development environment:

```bash
docker compose up -d -f docker-compose-dev.yml
```

### Viewing Logs

To view the logs of the development environment:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 4830 already in use**: Check if another service is using the port:
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 4830
   ```

2. **Docker permission issues**: Add your user to the docker group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
   Then log out and log back in.

3. **Container won't start**: Check the logs:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs
   ```
