# Developer Installation

FeatherPanel can be installed manually for development purposes, allowing live development and testing of the panel.

:::warning Developer Only
This installation method is **intended for developers only**. It is **not recommended for production use** or normal users, as running the panel in this way can be risky and is difficult to maintain. Proceed only if you understand the risks and are comfortable with development environments.

## Prerequisites

If your system is not listed above, you may still be able to install and run FeatherPanel by installing the required dependencies for your distribution.

### System Requirements

To run FeatherPanel in development mode, you will need:

- A Linux system capable of running Docker containers
- Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
- At least 10GB of free disk space
- Root or sudo access

# Installation Guide

FeatherPanel is a powerful web-based control panel designed to run on your own server. This guide will walk you through the complete installation process. Please note that root access to your server is required to install and operate this panel.

Before proceeding, we strongly recommend reading through this entire guide to ensure a smooth installation process. Taking the time to understand each step will help prevent common installation issues.

> This method **WILL GIVE PLUGINS AND ALL PANEL CODE FULL ROOT ACCESS TO YOUR ENTIRE FILESYSTEM**.  
> If you are hacked, the attacker could **compromise or delete everything on your server**.  
>
> **This guide is strictly for plugin developers and advanced contributors.**  
>  
> **DO NOT** use this method for production servers or for regular panel usage!  
>  
> For safe operation, you should always use the [Docker installation method](/docs/featherpanel/welcome-featherpanel) for FeatherPanel, which provides strong isolation and security.  
>  
> **Again: This is an unsafe method intended ONLY for quickly debugging, developing, or extending FeatherPanel. Proceed ONLY if you understand and accept the risks.**


## Prerequisites

### Installing Composer
Composer is PHP's dependency manager, essential for managing the panel's PHP packages:
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

### Installing Node Version Manager (NVM)

To manage Node.js versions easily, it’s recommended to use [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Install NVM with the following command:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, either restart your terminal, or run these lines *exactly as shown* to load `nvm` into your current session:
```bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

> ℹ️  
> The install script will automatically attempt to update your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to load nvm in the future.  
> If your shell doesn't load nvm after a restart, check your profile files or manually add the above lines.

You can verify that NVM is working by running:
```bash
nvm --version
```

Once NVM is installed, you can quickly install and switch Node.js versions as needed:
```bash
nvm install --lts   # Install latest LTS version
```

For more details and troubleshooting, see the [official NVM documentation](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

### Installing pnpm

FeatherPanel's frontend uses pnpm, a fast and efficient package manager for Node.js, to manage dependencies.

npm-check-updates is included to make it easy to check for and update outdated frontend packages. You can run `ncu` to check for package updates and `ncu -u` to upgrade your `package.json` dependencies automatically.

Install pnpm globally with the following command:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm npm-check-updates
```

You can verify that pnpm is installed by running:
```bash
pnpm --version
```

> ℹ️  
> If you encounter any issues, consult the [pnpm installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation) for troubleshooting steps and additional installation methods.

Once pnpm is installed, you'll be able to install all frontend dependencies in later steps.


## Initial Setup

Following these steps carefully will ensure a smooth installation process for FeatherPanel.


### Downloading and Extracting Files

Create the installation directory and download the latest release:
```bash
mkdir -p /var/www
cd /var/www
git clone https://github.com/mythicalltd/featherpanel.git featherpanel
```

Set appropriate permissions for the application directories:
```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/featherpanel/*
cd /var/www/featherpanel
```

### Installing Dependencies

#### Backend
Install all required dependencies:
```bash
COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER=1 composer install --working-dir=/var/www/featherpanel/backend
```

#### Frontend
Install all required dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install --dir /var/www/featherpanel/frontend/
```

### Creating Database and User
Set up the database and create a user with appropriate permissions:
```sql
mariadb -u root -p
CREATE USER 'featherpanel'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourPassword';
CREATE DATABASE featherpanel;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON featherpanel.* TO 'featherpanel'@'127.0.0.1' WITH GRANT OPTION;
exit
```

### Cron Job Configuration

It's best practice to run the FeatherPanel cron jobs as the `www-data` user rather than `root`. To do this, edit the crontab for `www-data`:

```bash
sudo crontab -u www-data -e
```

Then add the following lines to the bottom of the file:

```bash
* * * * * bash /var/www/featherpanel/backend/storage/cron/runner.bash >> /dev/null 2>&1
* * * * * php /var/www/featherpanel/backend/storage/cron/runner.php >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

This will ensure the cron jobs run with the appropriate permissions for your web application.


### Database Connection Setup
Configure the database connection settings:
```php
php app setup
```

### Running Database Migrations
Apply the database migrations to set up the required tables and structure:
```php
php app migrate
```

### Building the Frontend

To build the frontend after installing dependencies, run:

```bash
cd /var/www/featherpanel/frontend
pnpm build
```

This will generate the production-ready files in the `dist` directory, which can then be served by your web server.

> **Tip:**  
> If you're a developer and want to test the app with live frontend updates as you code, use the watch command instead:
>
> ```bash
> cd /var/www/featherpanel/frontend
> pnpm watch
> ```
>
> This will start the development server and automatically reload the frontend whenever you make changes.
