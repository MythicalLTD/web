# Building the frontend

To build the frontend you need a few things like

- NodeJS
- Yarn
- Brain (Hardest one)

## Installing the required packages

First make sure you are inside frontend directory! :))
Now let yarn download all his dependencies and do his magic!
```bash
yarn
```

## Building the frontend

Now that you have all that jucy 40gb of packages 😁 lets build em 

```bash
yarn build 
```

## Test the frontend

Don't feel like building the frontend every time you want to test smth?

```bash
yarn dev
```

Has got you back ❤️!
