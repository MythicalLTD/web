# Error Codes

Wonder what the hack the frontend wants to tell you or what the error codes really mean?

Haha sometimes we have no idea as well but here is some document things the frontend might tell ya!

## Authentication Error Codes

- `69100` - The username is already in use.
- `69101` - The email is already in use.
