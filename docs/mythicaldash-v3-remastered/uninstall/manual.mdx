# Manual Installation Uninstall

This guide covers completely removing MythicalDash when you have installed it manually without Docker.

:::danger Complete Removal
This process will permanently delete all MythicalDash data. Make sure you have backups if you need them.
:::

## Step 1: Create Backup (Optional)

If you might want to restore MythicalDash later, create a backup first:

### Database Backup
```bash
cd /var/www/mythicaldash-v3
mariadb-dump -p mythicaldash_remastered > mythicaldash_final_backup.sql
```

### Files Backup
```bash
cd /var/www
zip -r mythicaldash_final_backup.zip mythicaldash-v3/
```

## Step 2: Remove Crontab Jobs

Remove any scheduled tasks for MythicalDash:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Remove these lines if they exist:
```
* * * * * bash /var/www/mythicaldash-v3/backend/storage/cron/runner.bash >> /dev/null 2>&1
* * * * * php /var/www/mythicaldash-v3/backend/storage/cron/runner.php >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Step 3: Remove Web Server Configuration

### For Nginx
Remove the Nginx configuration files:

```bash
# Remove site configuration
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-available/MythicalDashRemastered.conf
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/MythicalDashRemastered.conf

# Or if you used a different naming convention
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-available/mythicaldash*
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/mythicaldash*
```

### For Apache
Remove the Apache virtual host:

```bash
# Disable the site
sudo a2dissite mythicaldash

# Remove configuration files
sudo rm -f /etc/apache2/sites-available/mythicaldash*.conf
sudo rm -f /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/mythicaldash*.conf
```

## Step 4: Remove SSL Certificates (Optional)

If you created SSL certificates specifically for MythicalDash:

```bash
# Remove Let's Encrypt certificates (replace with your domain)
sudo certbot delete --cert-name your-domain.com
```

## Step 5: Remove the Database

Remove the database and user:

```bash
mariadb -u root -p
```

Execute these SQL commands:
```sql
DROP DATABASE mythicaldash_remastered;
DROP USER 'mythicaldash_remastered'@'127.0.0.1';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
```

## Step 6: Remove Application Files

Delete the MythicalDash directory:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/www/mythicaldash-v3
```

## Step 7: Restart Web Server

Restart your web server to apply configuration changes:

### For Nginx
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### For Apache
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

## Step 8: Clean Up Dependencies (Optional)

If you installed dependencies specifically for MythicalDash and don't need them for other applications:

### Remove PHP packages (be careful with this)
```bash
# Only run this if you're sure other applications don't need these packages
sudo apt remove php8.3-{gd,mysql,mbstring,bcmath,xml,fpm,curl,zip,redis}
```

### Remove Composer (optional)
```bash
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/composer
```

## Verification

After completing the uninstall:

1. **Check web access** - Your domain should no longer serve MythicalDash
2. **Verify database removal** - Login to MariaDB and confirm the database is gone
3. **Check processes** - Ensure no MythicalDash processes are running
4. **Verify file removal** - Confirm `/var/www/mythicaldash-v3` is deleted

## Complete

MythicalDash has been completely removed from your server. All application files, databases, and configurations have been deleted.
