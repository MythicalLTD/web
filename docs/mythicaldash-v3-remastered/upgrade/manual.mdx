# Manual Installation Upgrade

This guide covers upgrading MythicalDash when you have installed it manually without Docker.

## Step 1: Create Backup

Before starting the upgrade process, create a complete backup of your current installation:

### Database Backup
```bash
cd /var/www/mythicaldash-v3
mariadb-dump -p mythicaldash_remastered > mythicaldash_backup.sql
```

### Files Backup
```bash
cd /var/www
zip -r mythicaldash_backup.zip mythicaldash-v3/
```

## Step 2: Download the Update

Download the latest version from GitHub:

```bash
cd /var/www/mythicaldash-v3
curl -Lo MythicalDash.zip https://github.com/MythicalLTD/MythicalDash/releases/latest/download/MythicalDash.zip
unzip -o MythicalDash.zip -d /var/www/mythicaldash-v3
```

## Step 3: Update Dependencies

Update the core components of the dashboard:

```bash
cd /var/www/mythicaldash-v3/backend
COMPOSER_ALLOW_SUPERUSER=1 composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

## Step 4: Database Updates

Update your database schema for the newest version:

```bash
cd /var/www/mythicaldash-v3
php mythicaldash migrate
```

## Step 5: Set Permissions

Set the proper owner of the files to your webserver user:

```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/mythicaldash-v3/*
```

:::note
The webserver user may vary by system. Common users include `www-data`, `nginx`, `apache`, or `nobody`.

## Step 6: Set Production Mode

Enable production mode for optimal performance:

```bash
cd /var/www/mythicaldash-v3
make set-prod
```

## Verification

After completing the upgrade:

1. **Check your website** - Visit your MythicalDash URL to ensure it loads properly
2. **Verify functionality** - Test key features like server management
3. **Check logs** - Review application logs for any errors

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- **Check permissions**: Ensure all files have correct ownership
- **Review logs**: Check `/var/www/mythicaldash-v3/storage/logs/` for errors
- **Restore backup**: If needed, restore from your backup files

## Done

You are now running the latest version of MythicalDash! The upgrade process is complete.
