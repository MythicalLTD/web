## Prerequisites

### Installing Composer
Composer is PHP's dependency manager, essential for managing the panel's PHP packages:
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

### Installing Yarn
Yarn manages Node.js dependencies for the frontend components:
```bash
npm i -g yarn
```

## Initial Setup

### Downloading and Extracting Files
Create the installation directory and download the latest release:
```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/mythicaldash-v3
cd /var/www/mythicaldash-v3
curl -Lo MythicalDash.zip https://github.com/MythicalLTD/MythicalDash/releases/latest/download/MythicalDash.zip
unzip -o MythicalDash.zip -d /var/www/mythicaldash-v3
```

Set appropriate permissions for the application directories:
```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/mythicaldash-v3/*
```

### Installing Dependencies
Install all required dependencies:
```bash
cd /var/www/mythicaldash-v3
make install
```

## Database Configuration

### MariaDB Character Set Configuration
Configure MariaDB with the correct character set settings:
```bash
sudo sed -i '/^#collation-server/a collation-server = utf8mb4_general_ci' /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
sudo sed -i '/^character-set-server/s/^/#/g' /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
sudo sed -i '/^#character-set-server/a character-set-server = utf8mb4' /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf

sudo sed -i '/^character-set-collations/s/^/#/g' /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
sudo sed -i '/^#character-set-collations/a character-set-collations = utf8mb4' /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
```

### Creating Database and User
Set up the database and create a user with appropriate permissions:
```sql
mariadb -u root -p
CREATE USER 'mythicaldash_remastered'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourPassword';
CREATE DATABASE mythicaldash_remastered;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mythicaldash_remastered.* TO 'mythicaldash_remastered'@'127.0.0.1' WITH GRANT OPTION;
exit
```

## Application Build and Configuration

### Building the Application
Build the application to ensure all dependencies are properly installed:
```bash
make release
```

### Cron Job Configuration
Configure the required cron jobs for background processing and queue management:
```bash
* * * * * bash /var/www/mythicaldash-v3/backend/storage/cron/runner.bash >> /dev/null 2>&1
* * * * * php /var/www/mythicaldash-v3/backend/storage/cron/runner.php >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Database Connection Setup
Configure the database connection settings:
```php
php mythicaldash setup
```

### Running Database Migrations
Apply the database migrations to set up the required tables and structure:
```php
php mythicaldash migrate
```

### Configuring Pterodactyl Connection
Now that we have this, we have to configure the pterodactyl panel so we can use this dashboard.

```php
php mythicaldash pterodactyl configure
```

### Getting admin

To get administrator on the first user you just have to run the command:

```php
php mythicaldash makeAdmin
```

And it will grant you administrator user! Keep in mind you might have to press (CTRL+R) when you login
