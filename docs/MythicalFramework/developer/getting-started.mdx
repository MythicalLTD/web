# Getting started

## Type of developers

Welcome to the developer documentation of MythicalFramework

This documentation goes on how MythicalFramework works and how you can use it in your advantages!

Now if you are a developer there are 4 types of things you can base on

- [API Developer](#api-developer) (Use the api for other projects) [External Developer]
- [Plugin Developer](#plugin-developer) (Developer of plugins) [External Developer]
- [Frontend Developer](#frontend-developer) (Developer of themes) [Internal Developer]
- [Backend Developer](#backend-developer) (Developer of the `/app` folder) [Internal Developer]


## API Developer

If you are an api developer, your only and only job is to try to make a 3rd party app from outside the app without editing any components from inside the app
this means that the only kind of documentation you need is a postman documentation witch you can find under here: https://www.postman.com/mythicalsystems/workspace/mythicalframework


## Plugin Developer

If you are a plugin developer, it means that you are allowed to modify the components on how MythicalFramework works!

This means that you can create your own plugins to add your own integration to this platform and maybe to some other ppl that use our framework!

You as a plugin developer are responsible for handling everything what's inside the `storage/addons` & `storage/themes` folder!

You are not allowed to touch or modify any of the core components of the framework on the user end!

And even if you think so, make sure that you know that you have something called `events` witch not a lot of apps have!

### What are events?

Events are the same thing as in minecraft basically, it means that there are actions performed while something happens an example of this is

- OnUserLogin 
- OnUserRegister
- OnUserPageLoad
- OnUserLogout

Those are some simple self explaining events! 

Make sure that you know that those events are triggered before or even after the framework code was executed and in some instances you may not be able to cancel that event!

Every event has its own documentation, and you should first look into it before you start coding any plugin ;)

### Unwritten rules

As a plugin developer there are some unwritten rules that you should follow:

- You are not allowed to escape the addons directory
- You are not allowed to modify anything but the addon files
- You should respect the coding standards of normal backend developers
- You should document everything you do so you can help yourself 

### How to create a plugin?

If you want to create your first plugin, make sure to check this documentation out: [Creating your first plugin](/docs/MythicalFramework/developer/plugins/getting-started)

## Frontend Developer

If you are a frontend developer you are responsible for the `/storage/themes` folder!

This means that you are allowed to modify the frontend of the app and make it look like you want it to look like!
Make sure that you know that the files have to stay in the same place and with the same name or else the app is going to break ;)

### Unwritten rules
As a frontend developer there are some unwritten rules that you should follow:

- Do not modify anything else than the frontend and the themes folder!
- Make sure you format every file you touch!
- Make sure you have no css or js errors!
- Make sure you have no html errors!
- Make sure you don't add extra code to the app
- Your theme should work if you just copy paste the theme folder and the dist folder to another server.

### Use webpack
Make sure you use webpack to compile your code and make sure you have a dist folder with the compiled code!

### Don't leave trash behind
Make sure you don't leave any trash behind like unused files or folders or css prios that are not needed!

## Backend Developer

If you are a backend developer you are responsible for the `/app` folder!

This means that you are allowed to modify the backend of the app and make it work like you want it to work like!
Make sure that you know that the files have to stay in the same place and with the same name or else the app is going to break ;)

Make sure you know that you as a backend dev you are responsible for everything and before you push anything make sure that you know that there may be functions 
that you changed or modified in a way that will break things like plugins or even app functions!

As a backend developer you are kinda responsible for the hole app to work and make sure that if something worked before it should work now as well!

### Unwritten rules
As a backend developer there are some unwritten rules that you should follow:

- Do not touch the core components of the app (Kernel/Encryption)
- Create unit tests for everything you can
- Make sure you make your code as readable as you can (WhiteSpaces Empty Lines)
- Make sure you document everything since no documentation means that that is not done
- Make sure you respect the coding standards like commenting your code and more
- For things like bools strings or other value you should name them like: `str_value` or `bool_value`

### Don't reinvent the wheel
And with all of that in mind make sure you respect other developers and don't reinvent the wheel because if it works it works there is no need to rewrite something that already works only if there is a valid reason like

- Faster loading time
- Better Security
- Something else 

With all of that now in mind you might start making changes to the framework and build a better web with us! `<3`
