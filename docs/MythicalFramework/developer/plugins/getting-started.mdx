# Getting started

This tutorial will teach you on how to create a new plugin for MythicalFramework!

First you have to learn php :)

## Naming your plugin

Next after you have that you will have to go inside the `storage/addons` folder and create a new folder with the addon name you want to give it!
Here are some rules about naming your plugin/addon:

-   You can't use spaces
-   You can use any special character
-   It can't contain swear words
-   It can't impersonate another plugin name
-   It can't be named after a requirement for example (MythicalLicense) when MythicalLicense is a plugin used for licenses

Now that you have that make sure you create that folder with the plugin name.

Now that you have the folder make sure you create 2 files:

-   `MythicalFramework.json`
-   `PluginName.php`

After you create that here is how `MythicalFramework` should look like:

```json
{
    "name": "Core",
    "description": "The core plugin for MythicalFramework",
    "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythicalLTD/FrameworkBackup24/refs/heads/main/icon.png",
    "version": "1.0.1",
    "homepage": "https://mythical.systems",
    "require": [
        "MythicalSystemsFramework",
        "php=8.2.0",
        "php-ext=mysqli",
        "composer=mythicalsystems/core"
    ],
    "license": "MIT",
    "stability": "stable",
    "authors": [
        "NaysKutzu",
        "MythicalDoggo"
    ],
    "support": "https://discord.mythical.systems",
    "funding": "https://github.com/sponsors/nayskutzu"
}
```

Here is how the json file is built and what you should give:

### Name (Required)

This is the name of the plugin witch should always match the folder and the php file name!!!!!!

### Description (Required)

This is a brief up on what the plugin does and what it should do or how it should behave!

### Version (Required)

This is the version of the plugin and it is being used for auto updaters so make sure you do not fuck this up!

### Stability (Required)

This is what stability the plugin has and this can't be something random and has to be something from this list:

-   alpha
-   beta
-   dev
-   rc
-   stable

If anything else is used the plugin will be marked as invalid!

### Require (Required)

This is what the plugin requires in other to run its like a dependency for another plugin or a composer plugin or a php extension

#### Composer

For composer packages make sure it starts with:

-   `composer=mythicalsystems/core`

#### PHP

This is more like to get just the version and should be used like:

-   `php=8.2`

#### PHP-Ext

This is incase you need a php extension to be installed on the server and this can be used like:

-   `php-ext=pdo`

#### Anything else

If anything else is given that will be taken as a plugin name so the plugin name given should be installed on the server!

### Authors (Required)
 
This is a list and there has to be at least 1 in order for the plugin to boot!

### Homepage

This should be the plugin's homepage

### License

This is what type of license is getting used for the plugin: `MIT`

### Support

This is the support link that will show on the plugin

### Funding

This is the funding link for the plugin in case if you accept donations! :)

## Creating the plugin

The php file that you created has to be filled with some of the default values in order for our compiler to compile it:

```php

use MythicalSystemsFramework\Plugins\PluginBuilder;

class Test implements PluginBuilder
{
    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function Main(): void
    {
        // TODO: Implement the main function
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function Event(MythicalSystemsFramework\Plugins\PluginEvent $eventHandler): void
    {

    }
    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function onInstall(): void {
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function onUninstall(): void {
    }

    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function onUpdate(): void {
    }
}
```

This is a example of the file.

If any of the function is wrong or you added an argument or something else the plugin will not load this plugin and will mark this plugin as a violation!

After you do that you need to go to the web interface and allow this plugin to work!


### Using Events

Events are one of the most powerful thing that MythicalFramework has!

Events are things that happen when something happens like 

- When a user registered perform a action from plugin X 

Events are also well documented and you can find all of them in this documenation or just click this link: 

- [Example Event](/docs/MythicalFramework/developer/plugins/events/announcement-event)
  

### Adding Language files

If your plugin has a GUI interface like a web interface you may want to display messages from your plugin specific

For that you can just create a new folder called: `lang` and inside there you will need to add files like `en_US.yml` or 
other languages that your plugin support's!

On more info on how to use languages check this doc: 

- [Link](/docs/MythicalFramework/developer/developers/components/language)

### Displaying User feedback (Alerts)

This is in case you need to display error's or successful messages to the user!

You can do that by just redirecting the user to the path and appending `s` for successful or
`e` for error messages at the end of the url!

For more of that make sure you check this doc:

- [Link](/docs/MythicalFramework/developer/developers/components/alerts)

### Adding cron jobs

Woah it looks like you want to add cron jobs to plugins :))

For that you will have to create another folder called `crons` and inside you will need to place php files that look like this: 


```php
use MythicalSystemsFramework\Cli\Kernel;

echo Kernel::translateColorsCode('Hello, World!&o');
```

This will be a native php file and does not require any class usage or what so ever so you can do what ever you want!


REMEMBER!!! 

This class runs every one minute so you will have to make your own logic behind it if you want the job to run every 24h or so on!


### Adding CLI Commands

Woah we are sorry but this future has been removed due to some compatibility issues and due to this function being very dangerous!


Thats why onInstall and OnUninstall are a function in the plugin so it will compensate for the CLI!

### Adding Template Modifications

This is a future we are still working on and will take some time to release but for now you can use the `$renderer` event to figure something out!

### Adding new pages!

This is a event action and there is no built in function you can create pages but you can create pages using the `$event->emit('app.onAppLoad', [$router, $renderer]);`
