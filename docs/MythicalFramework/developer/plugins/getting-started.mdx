# Getting started

This tutorial will teach you on how to create a new plugin for MythicalFramework!

First you have to learn php :)

## Naming your plugin 

Next after you have that you will have to go inside the `storage/addons` folder and create a new folder with the addon name you want to give it!
Here are some rules about naming your plugin/addon:

- You can't use spaces
- You can use any special character
- It can't contain swear words 
- It can't impersonate another plugin name
- It can't be named after a requirement for example (MythicalLicense) when MythicalLicense is a plugin used for licenses

Now that you have that make sure you create that folder with the plugin name. 

Now that you have the folder make sure you create 2 files:

- `MythicalFramework.json`
- `PluginName.php`

After you create that here is how `MythicalFramework` should look like: 

```json
{
    "name": "Example",
    "description": "A framework for MythicalSystems",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "homepage": "https://mythicalsystems.xyz",
    "require": [
        "Test"
    ],
    "license": "MIT",
    "stability": "stable",
    "authors": [
        "NaysKutzu",
        "MythicalDoggo"
    ],
    "support": "https://discord.mythicalsystems.xyz",
    "funding": "https://github.com/sponsors/nayskutzu"
}
```

Here is how the json file is built and what you should give:

### Name (Required)
This is the name of the plugin witch should always match the folder and the php file name!!!!!!

### Description (Required)
This is a brief up on what the plugin does and what it should do or how it should behave!

### Version (Required)
This is the version of the plugin and it is being used for auto updaters so make sure you do not fuck this up!

### Stability (Required)
This is what stability the plugin has and this can't be something random and has to be something from this list:

- alpha
- beta
- dev
- rc
- stable

If anything else is used the plugin will be marked as invalid!

### Requires (Required)
This is what the plugin requires in other to run its like a dependency for another plugin or a composer plugin or a php extension


#### Composer 

For composer packages make sure it starts with: 
- `composer=mythicalsystems/core`

#### PHP 

This is more like to get just the version and should be used like: 

- `php=>=8.2`

#### PHP-Ext

This is incase you need a php extension to be installed on the server and this can be used like: 
- `php-ext=pdo`

#### Anything else

If anything else is given that will be taken as a plugin name so the plugin name given should be installed on the server!

### Authors
This is a list and there has to be at least 1 in order for the plugin to boot!

### Homepage
This should be the plugin's homepage

### License 
This is what type of license is getting used for the plugin: `MIT`

### Support 
This is the support link that will show on the plugin

### Funding 
This is the funding link for the plugin in case if you accept donations! :)


## Creating the plugin

The php file that you created has to be filled with some of the default values in order for our compiler to compile it: 

```php
<?php

use MythicalSystemsFramework\Plugins\PluginBuilder;

class Example implements PluginBuilder
{
    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function Main()
    {
        //TODO: Implement the main function
    }
    /**
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function Route(\Router\Router $router, \Twig\Environment $renderer)
    {
        
    }
}
```

This is a example of the file.

If any of the function is wrong or you added an argument or something else the plugin will not load this plugin and will mark this plugin as a violation!

After you do that you need to go to the web interface and allow this plugin to work!
