# Settings

Just like language class but settings is more dangerous since it has caches!!!

The settings class uses a database as the main settings path and then a settings.json file inside the cache folder so the app will load fast!

To use the settings class you will need to require the class: `\MythicalSystemsFramework\Managers\Settings`!


### Adding a setting to the database!

Here is simple code on how to add a new setting to the database!

#### PHP

```php
use MythicalSystemsFramework\Managers\Settings as settings;
// First value is the category of the setting
// Next is the name of the setting
// Value is self explanatory 
// The first true is if we should update the cache!
settings::setSetting('category',"name","value",true);
```

#### Twig 

```php
<!-- NOPE SINCE ITS SERVER SIDE ONLY !!!-->
```

### Getting a settings from the database!

Here is some code on how to get settings!

#### PHP

```php
use MythicalSystemsFramework\Managers\Settings as settings;

$value = settings::getSetting('category','name');
echo $value; 
```

#### Twig 

```html
<p>This setting is: {{setting('category','name') }}</p>
```

### Request a cache update!

This will update the cache manually

#### PHP 

```php
use MythicalSystemsFramework\Managers\Settings as settings;
settings::updateCache();
```

#### Twig 

```php
<!-- NOPE SINCE ITS SERVER SIDE ONLY !!!-->
```
