# Alerts

Alerts are a powerful function from MythicalFramework and are used to display feedback to the user!

If you are making a plugin and you need to display a error message you have to keep in mind that if you want to register the alerts
you have to register them at the end of the page load and not before since added globals after the register alerts will not be registered!!!!

If you are using the alert class you may already know that every alert message is a `GET` request at the end of the url!!

All alerts messages are taken from the language file!!!!

The alert library we use is `SweetAlert2` and is a requirement alongside the `JQuery` lib and many others!

Here is a full list of alerts you can show the user!
