# Language Manager

The language functions are simple functions to list the messages from the language files!

When using this function remember that the language is global and its not meant for the user to switch

the language to another file so if the website is based on english then everyone is going to have english as the main language

Remember this is a `.yml` file and its syntax should be respected and followed with paths like `Alerts.Success.Social.Liked.Message` to get a message!

For that you can use the extension that we developed for the framework so you can just right click and copy the full yaml path to the message!

-   https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MythicalSystems.mythicalframework-utils

With that installed you can just right click to the yaml message and click `Copy yaml path` and it will copy the full path string that you can use in php!

# IMPORTANT

If a message does not exist it will fall back to `null` and thats nothing so it will be empty so make sure the path is right!

Same goes for the yaml syntax if there is a violation nothing will display!!

## How to get a message?


### PHP

To get a message you can use the function: `\MythicalSystemsFramework\Language\Manager` class!

Here is a example on how to get a language!

```php
$language = new \MythicalSystemsFramework\Language\Manager();

$message = $language->get('Alerts.Success.Social.Liked.Message');

echo $message;
```
### TWIG (Theme)
This is an example in php but if you want to get a language inside twig (themes) you can use the twig function called `lang()`

Here is a example on how to do that using twig

```html
<h4 class="mb-1">{{ lang('Alerts.Success.Social.Liked.Message') }}</h4>
```

This example will work in every theme file because its a global value!


When using those examples make sure you replace `Alerts.Success.Social.Liked.Message` with the message you want to display in the code you need!

## Plugin side Language Integration

For now plugins can not add language messages to the app ;(
