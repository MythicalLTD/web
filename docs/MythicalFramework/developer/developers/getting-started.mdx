Documentation: How to Code in PHP and Coding Standards

This document provides a guide on how to code in PHP and outlines some coding standards that should be followed in every project.


1.  Coding Standards:
    -   Follow a consistent naming convention for variables, functions, and classes (e.g., camelCase or snake_case).
    -   Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
    -   Comment your code to improve readability and maintainability.
    -   Avoid using global variables whenever possible.
    -   Use proper error handling techniques to handle exceptions and errors.
    -   Sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    -   Use proper code organization and modularization to improve code maintainability.
    -   Follow the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) to avoid code duplication.
    -   Write unit tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
    -   Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with other developers.

By following these coding standards, you can write clean, maintainable, and efficient PHP code that is easy to understand and debug.

Now that you understand all of that you may want to look up each element in the table down there so you understand how the app works!
