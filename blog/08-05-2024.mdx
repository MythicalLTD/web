We are so sorry but we had to switch domains again due to me being a idiot and I forgot the account where the `mythicalsystems.me` domain was! 

So now our main primary domain is https://mythical.systems and all old stuff should reddirect to that domain becuase we are right now reddirecting ppl to the new domain and anyone using our api please update your endpoint to the new domain! 

You have a 6 month window to do that if you won't then thats your fault! When it comes to the new domain I have enabled auto renew for it and there are credits in my namecheap account for the domain to be alive for over 10 years ðŸ˜‰

There is no downtime what so ever and everything should work the same again on the new domain!

KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU MAY NEED TO WAIT UP TO 24H FOR THE SSL CERTIFICATE TO APPLY AND FOR EVERYTHING TO BE BACK HOW IT WAS!
