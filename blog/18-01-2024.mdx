We are so sorry to say this, but we are going to drop support for the following projects due to them not being used or being poorly written:
- MythicalPics (I have no time to maintain it)
- MythicalLauncher (May come back as an add-on for something I'm working on)
- MythicalLauncher API (Full of SQL injections and the main project is dead, so!!)
- EasySetup (It was for Oracle Cloud auto setup script, but I don't use it anymore.)
- MythicalWebPanel (which will be replaced by KosmaPanel)
- MythicalWebPanel-Daemon (Will be replaced by KosmaPanel)
- AAPanel-API (Will be still on the composer package list but won't get any updates!)
- MythicalNodes (Killed support for it one year ago, now I killed support for everything still running PANEL/CLIENT/IMAGES/REPOS)
- MythicalAuth (Will come back soon with another name)
- MythicalDash-Themes (Will be EOL since no one used it and the market can be used https://market.mythical.systems)
- MythicalGuard (There are other better tools online, and the SRC got leaked!) Now you can remove it!
- MythicalPics-Daemon (Code is poorly written and does not work, and the main project got archived too)

<hr></hr>
This means that we won't support them on Discord, provide updates or do anything else for them!
This also means that we drop the main copyrights on the projects, but you still have to give us credits.
For the years that the project was supported and who made them, aka (MythicalSystems)
