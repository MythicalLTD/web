# New begging!

Hello @everyone! There are some big announcements. We are going to rename our GitHub from MythicalLTD to MythicalSystems LTD, as we are now registered as an LTD company. 

Our company number is `15124191`, and more information can be viewed [here](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/15124191). 

As always, when we say "Mythical", "MythicalSys", "MythicalLTD" we mean "MythicalSystems LTD". 

When we refer to "MythicalSystems" or use pronouns such as "we", "us" or "our", we mean MythicalSystems LTD
