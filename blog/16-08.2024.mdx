So the dashboard will be a never seen dashboard even better then the ones out there and i can tell ya some things right now because they are kinda already done:

- New UI
- New Security Systems (Firewall/Rate Limiting/API Based)
- Frontend via HTML (Means that you will have a themes folder where you can upload a html theme and it will work :))
- Addons Support (Means you can drag and drop addons like minecraft plugins)
- A shit ton of developer friendly things (Plugin events like in minecraft/ A lot of documentation / Developer and Testing Tools)
- WebUI installer (Install from web :joy: )
- CLI Access (New rewritten CLI) [Support minecraft colors codes for console output :joy: ]
- Advanced Database Cache (Database will be saved on server and only if something changed the cache will be redownloaded) [Blazing Fast Loadings]
- Minecraft Style Permission System (Like luckperms [Exactly like luckperms like will be prefixes for addons and stuff like that])
- Easy Translation System (Just have a webui where you can change every message like you want (AI Powered as well))
- AI ChatBot (Will be shipped for servers that have GPU's :))
- Mail System (Nice MailSystem for auth/server creations and much more)
- Free and Premium Host Support (So you can sell or provide for free)
- Activity Logs for users (Everything gets logged like every action :))
- Built in anti nuke systems :slight_smile:
- Backup systems to take database and file system backups of the dash!
- Easy Support with MythicalAPI (Logs getting uploaded to cloud if you want to get support or if we find something we can fix it)
- Auto Updaters if enabled :slight_smile:
- Manage Server from the dashboard itself
- Unit Tests (For devs and other users to know if something is really wrong with the dash)
- Standalone (Wont require pterodactyl to run because you can just add panels or whatever you want with our addons system)
- Self Healing (Something broke or missing? Np it will get fixed on a cli command or via the web interface)

About 40% of this is is open source already inside our framework that's is not done yet and when that will be done then the work for the dash will be resumed!

And keep in mind all of this will be free :heart:
